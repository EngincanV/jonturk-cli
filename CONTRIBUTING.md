## Contribution Guide

Thanks for considering contributing to this project. There is a set of actions that you should follow in case we better communicate with each other and make your contribution to this project as easy as possible. Therefore, please read the next sections and follow them. Thanks in advance!

### What you should do? 

* Creating an issue about your feature request or bug report. ✅
  * Each contribution should start with an issue. Thus, first, you should check if there is an existing issue and if there is not, you should [create an issue](https://github.com/EngincanV/jonturk-cli/issues/new) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/EngincanV/jonturk-cli/discussions) on the repository.
* Wait for an initial response for the issue (it should be discussed and approved). ✅
* You can fix obvious problems, mistakes, and typos, without the need to wait for approval, right away. ✅
* Send a PR that closes the related issue. (Please write critical points in the PR description) ✅

### What you should not do?

* Sending PRs directly without any explicit descriptions. ❌
* Implementing a feature or fixing a bug, without examining the project overall. (This can cause misunderstanding and reduce the code quality of the project) ❌
